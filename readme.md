   # SCRAPP - A WEBPACK BOILERPLATE
   ## A good starting point to develop with webpack.
   Configuration of the webpack can be very complicated and time consuming. Simply skip this part and start developing with this little framework.

   ### WEBPACK features
   - HTML nested Templates (f.ex: footer, header)
   - File Loaders
   - Autoprefixer
   - Webpack dev server


   ### FRAMEWORK features
   - lazy loading images with LOZAD

   ### Start working
   - clone the repo git clone https://github.com/web-designed/scrapp.git your_custom_name
   - download the node_modules with "yarn install" or "npm install"
   - run the dev-server with "yarn run dev-server" or "npm run dev-server"
   - that's it now start editing and adding your files.
